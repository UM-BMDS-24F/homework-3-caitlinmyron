I downloaded BLAST+ for its usability with a command line, no restrictions on size, and the fact we are dealing with protein sequences (not DNA/RNA or other). Version 2.16.0+ was the most recently updated version I could access from the NCBI site.

I decided to use the matrix BLOSUM80 due to the fact that human and mouse proteins are highly conserved - that is, they are very related. A quick google search supports that the protein-coding sequences (and therefore, the proteins they encode) are 85% or more related. Therefore, BLOSUM80, a matrix built from blocks with less than 80% similarity, should be more suitable than BLOSUM62 or BLOSUM45.

Parameters:

cmd: using blastp for protein analysis

query: using a temporary fasta file containing one seqRecord at a time

db: using the database I created called "mouse" which contains the info from mouse.fa

evalue: specifies we only want matches with max e-value 0.001 (high-quality alignment, the probability of the alignment occurring by chance is no more than 0.001)

matrix: using BLOSUM80 due to high similarity between human and mouse proteins; very conserved

out: writing to an xml file so that I can use NCBIXML.parse to parse the BLAST results

outfmt: using format #5 because this is for xml files
